There are three specific steps for implementing the Social Media Web User Control:

1. Add the SocialMediaSharingStyles.css to the head section of the 
   page (or these can be added to the site's main stylesheet, either method works).

2. Add the SocialMediaSharingScript.js directly after the opening body 
   tag. This file contains all the scripts required for the buttons to work.

3. Add the SocialMediaSharingControl.ascx to the project and place it on the 
   aspx page (design mode).
